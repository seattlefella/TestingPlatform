Testing Platform for Unity game mechanic development
========

This project makes available to the user a reasonably complex scene to develop game mechanics  

The user should simply create a branch, download the standard assets and develop their game mechanic.

Note: Git will not track the build directory, any 3rd party software and the standard Assets.

Several basic (free) models from: http://devassets.com/  are in the default scene
- please visit the site and look for new additions and/or reach out to the authors.

The basic look and feel of the sample scene is taken from Brackeys
